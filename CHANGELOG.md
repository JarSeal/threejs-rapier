# Changelog

One entry per branch merged to `main`, newest first, written in that branch's PR next to its version bumps (see "Versioning" in `.claude/CLAUDE.md`). Each entry has a section per part that changed: **Engine** (`src/_engine/`), **Toolkit** (`src/toolkit/`) and **App** (`src/app/` and the app-level files in `src/`). **Project** covers repo tooling that belongs to none of them. A part without a section kept its version.

Earlier releases are only recorded in the git history.

## 2026-09-29 — skybox-overhaul

### Engine 3.0.0 (Zenith)

**Added**

- Layered sky box definitions (`SkyBoxDef`): a `base` layer (`COLOR`, `EQUIRECTANGULAR` or `CUBE_TEXTURE`, with `rotate`, cube `flipY` and `intensity`) and an `env` layer (`backgroundRoughness`, `backgroundIntensity`, `environmentIntensity`, and the env bake's `size`, `dynamic`, `updateAngleDeg` and `maxUpdatesPerSec`). `preset` is accepted but not used yet.
- Procedural sky layers: `atmosphere` (Preetham scattering, a port of three's `SkyMesh`, with a sky-only `exposure`, `sunIntensity`, `twilightLength`, `nightSkyColor` and horizon/zenith tints), `suns[]` (disc and halo; `suns[0]` drives the atmosphere and is the only one drawn for now), `clouds` (SkyMesh's, with a tint and wind direction; they need the atmosphere) and `ground` (the lower hemisphere's colour, with a `height` and aerial perspective). A layer is on when its key is there, unless it says `enabled: false`.
- Sky boxes with a procedural layer composite every layer into one background node and bake their environment from it (`fromScene` into a fixed target, at most once per frame and never while a scene loads). `env.size` is 64, 128, 256 or 512; `env.dynamic: false` bakes only on activation, rebuilds and `bakeEnvironment()` (new). Texture-only and colour-only sky boxes are unchanged.
- Sky lights: `suns[i].light` adds a directional light that follows the sun (AUTO colour from the atmosphere, fading out below the horizon, shadows following the active camera snapped to shadow texels), and `ambientLight` a hemisphere or ambient light (off by default). Both are ordinary ECS lights.
- Day-night cycle (`dayNight`): the sun and moon are placed from a time of day (latitude, day of year, axial tilt, north offset), and the stars turn with the sky. It advances with the app loop by default (`timeSource: 'APP' | 'MAIN' | 'MANUAL'`) and is driven at runtime with `setTimeOfDay`/`getTimeOfDay`, `playDayNight`, `pauseDayNight`, `isDayNightPlaying`, `setDayNightSpeed`/`getDayNightSpeed` (negative runs it backwards) and `setDayNightCycleDuration`. `getSunDirection`, `getSunElevation`, `getMoonDirection` and `getMoonPhase` read the sky. Nothing is allocated per frame while it plays.
- While the cycle moves, the environment re-bakes once the sun or moon has turned `env.updateAngleDeg` (default 1°), at most `env.maxUpdatesPerSec` (default 1) times a second, and once more when it stops or reverses. `env.size` defaults to 128 with day-night.
- `moons[]`: a disc lit into its `phase` (fixed, or `phaseMode: 'CYCLE'` over `lunarCycleDays`), with earthshine, limb darkening and an optional `texture` (`DISC` or `EQUIRECTANGULAR`). `moons[i].light` is a managed directional light that only shines at night (scaled by the lit fraction; no shadow by default). Clouds get moonlight at night. Only `moons[0]` is drawn for now.
- `stars`: procedural stars (cube-projected, two grids, colour temperatures, twinkle), faded in through twilight by `fadeRange` and turning with the sky, with an optional `milkyWay` band. They cost nothing by day and are never baked.
- `isAppPlaying()` in `MainLoop.ts`: a cheap per-frame read of whether the app loop plays.
- Sky box debug tab: a Day-night folder (a runtime transport: play, ×−10…×100 speed buttons, a speed slider, a time scrub that pauses while dragged, and readouts; and the cycle's config), Moon (with a Light subfolder) and Stars folders, and a bakes-per-second readout.
- Managed entities: `CoreEntityOpts.managedBy` (code only) adds the new `MANAGED_BY` component. A managed light gets no saved debug overrides, and the Lights tab shows it read-only with a link to its manager's tab.
- `openDebuggerTab(id)`.
- Sky box debug tab: Sun (with a Light subfolder), Atmosphere, Clouds, Ground and Ambient light folders, and env bake settings and stats (bake count, CPU and GPU ms) in the Environment folder.
- Sky box API in `core/SkyBox/SkyBox.ts`: `registerSkyBox`, `setActiveSkyBox`, `getActiveSkyBox`, `updateSkyBox`, `activateSceneDefaultSkyBox`, `getSceneDefaultSkyBoxId`, `getActiveEnvironmentTexture` and `onSkyBoxChange`, plus the `SkyBoxDef` and `ActiveSkyBox` types.
- `gatherAppData` validates `*.skybox.json` files and inline scene sky boxes, keeps their `debugData` outside production, and deep-merges a scene's save entry into the definition.
- Sky box debug tab: Base and Environment folders (each with "Reset layer"), Copy JSON, and a clear button for the stored edits. Edits persist per scene and sky box, and only the values that differ from the definition are stored. Undo/redo covers every value, layer resets and the selection.
- `utils/deepMerge.ts`.

**Changed**

- Breaking: the sky box module moved from `core/SkyBox.ts` to `core/SkyBox/SkyBox.ts`.
- Breaking: `createSkyBox` takes a `SkyBoxDef`. The legacy `{ type, params }` props and JSON still work, with a dev warning. `isCurrent` becomes `isDefault`, `params.roughness` becomes `env.backgroundRoughness`, and `rotate` is in radians (the legacy cube rotate was a multiple of π).
- Sky boxes use three.js's standard orientation, and the background and the environment sample the same direction. Legacy definitions convert to `rotate: π` (equirect) or `flipY: true` (cube), which keeps their look. A cube's `flipY` now turns it upside down (a half turn about X).
- Activating a sky box sets `scene.environmentIntensity`, `backgroundIntensity` and `environmentRotation` from its definition; clearing resets them.
- The debug localStorage key `AEK_debugSkyBoxStates` is replaced by `AEK_debugSkyBox`. A saved background roughness is migrated once, and the old key is removed.
- `deepMerge` merges an index object (`{ "0": { ... } }`) into an array by index instead of replacing the array.
- The PostFX profiler's GPU timing moved to a shared debug timer (`_dbg__GPUTimer.ts`), also used by the env bake stats.

**Removed**

- `defaultRoughness`, `defaultSkyBoxState`, `SkyBoxState`, `SkyBoxProps` (now `LegacySkyBoxProps`), `LS_KEY_ALL_STATES`, `NO_SKYBOX_ID`, `extractSkyBoxParamsFromState`, `getEnvMapRoughnessBg`, `getCurSceneSkyBoxSceneId`, `deleteCurrentSkyBox` (use `setActiveSkyBox(null)`) and `applySkyBoxForScene`.
- `DebugToolsState.env` (the unused env ball state).
- `PROJECT_METADATA.mergeVersion` (deprecated in 2.1.0).

**Fixed**

- Materials got no view-dependent reflections and ignored their own roughness: the environment was sampled with the background's direction and roughness. Scenes can look more reflective; tune `env.environmentIntensity`.
- Cube sky boxes didn't light materials at all, and equirect lighting came in upside down relative to the background.
- A non-HDR equirect's `path` was dropped, a roughness of `0` was lost, and an empty `colorSpace` wasn't treated as unset.
- An equirect's orientation depended on where its texture loaded (main thread or assets worker).
- Sky box selections in the debugger could race each other.
- `setCurrentScene` didn't reset the root scene's `environmentNode`.

### App 1.3.0 (Preschooler)

**Added**

- `skyShowcase` scene: a `dayNight` sky box with every procedural layer on a 5-minute day, rows of metal and dielectric PBR spheres (roughness 0 to 1) and a stone gate that casts long shadows. It is the verification scene for the sky box plans.
- `scene01_v2`: a row of PBR spheres (roughness 0 to 1) that show the environment.

**Changed**

- The app's sky boxes (`scene01`, `scene01_v2`, the gym and `basicSkybox.skybox.json`) use layered definitions, with the same look.
- The gym's environment intensity is set in its sky box definitions (`env.environmentIntensity`) instead of by hand on scene enter and exit.

## 2026-09-29 — spatial-index-system-visualizer

### Engine 2.1.0 (Morning)

**Added**

- Spatial index visualizer in the "Spatial index" debugger tab: wireframe boxes for the occupied grid cells and, separately, for the oversized tier's members, each with its own checkbox and color picker (persisted).
- `SpatialGrid.cellSize`, `SpatialGrid.getOccupiedCellBoundsInto(out)` and `SpatialGrid.getOversizedBoundsInto(out)`.
- `PROJECT_METADATA.toolkit`, the `x-toolkit` meta tag, the `%TOOLKIT_*%` HTML placeholders and a toolkit line in the boot console log.
- Optional `engineVersion`/`toolkitVersion`/`appVersion` in save data `__meta`. `gatherAppData` warns when an applied save entry was stamped under another major version.

**Changed**

- The version checksum also covers the toolkit version and codename, and no longer includes the merge version (existing checksum values change once).
- The boot log no longer writes versions into `#engineVersion`/`#appVersion` DOM elements (they no longer exist).

**Deprecated**

- `PROJECT_METADATA.mergeVersion`, to be removed in the next major version. The `x-merge-version` meta tag is removed.

**Fixed**

- The physics debug wireframe of heightfield colliders was drawn with the wrong layout (sheared and transposed).
- A heightfield collider's column count was read from `nrows`, which broke non-square heightfields.

### Toolkit 1.0.0 (Crescent)

**Added**

- Versioned on its own for the first time (`toolkit_metadata` in `package.json`; it was previously covered by the engine version). Its codenames follow the moon's phases.
- Included in the `yarn docs` TypeDoc output.

### Project

**Added**

- `yarn checkVersions` checks the versioning rules; `--against main` also checks each part's bump. The Stop hook runs the base check whenever `package.json` changes.
- `yarn tagRelease` tags a merge on `main` per part (`engine-v…`, `toolkit-v…`, `app-v…`).
- This changelog.
