# Changelog

One entry per branch merged to `main`, newest first, written in that branch's PR next to its version bumps (see "Versioning" in `.claude/CLAUDE.md`). Each entry has a section per part that changed: **Engine** (`src/_engine/`), **Toolkit** (`src/toolkit/`) and **App** (`src/app/` and the app-level files in `src/`). **Project** covers repo tooling that belongs to none of them. A part without a section kept its version.

Earlier releases are only recorded in the git history.

## 2026-09-29 — spatial-index-system-visualizer

### Engine 2.1.0 (Morning)

**Added**

- Spatial index visualizer in the "Spatial index" debugger tab: wireframe boxes for the occupied grid cells and, separately, for the oversized tier's members, each with its own checkbox and color picker (persisted).
- `SpatialGrid.cellSize`, `SpatialGrid.getOccupiedCellBoundsInto(out)` and `SpatialGrid.getOversizedBoundsInto(out)`.
- `PROJECT_METADATA.toolkit`, the `x-toolkit` meta tag, the `%TOOLKIT_*%` HTML placeholders and a toolkit line in the boot console log.
- Optional `engineVersion`/`toolkitVersion`/`appVersion` in save data `__meta`. `gatherAppData` warns when an applied save entry was stamped under another major version.

**Changed**

- The version checksum also covers the toolkit version and codename, and no longer includes the merge version (existing checksum values change once).
- The boot log no longer writes versions into `#engineVersion`/`#appVersion` DOM elements (they no longer exist).

**Deprecated**

- `PROJECT_METADATA.mergeVersion`, to be removed in the next major version. The `x-merge-version` meta tag is removed.

**Fixed**

- The physics debug wireframe of heightfield colliders was drawn with the wrong layout (sheared and transposed).
- A heightfield collider's column count was read from `nrows`, which broke non-square heightfields.

### Toolkit 1.0.0 (Crescent)

**Added**

- Versioned on its own for the first time (`toolkit_metadata` in `package.json`; it was previously covered by the engine version). Its codenames follow the moon's phases.
- Included in the `yarn docs` TypeDoc output.

### Project

**Added**

- `yarn checkVersions` checks the versioning rules; `--against main` also checks each part's bump. The Stop hook runs the base check whenever `package.json` changes.
- `yarn tagRelease` tags a merge on `main` per part (`engine-v…`, `toolkit-v…`, `app-v…`).
- This changelog.
